            <h1> Things to know about how to save money</h1>
            <li><b>Tip #1 - Keep track of your expenses</b></li>
             <p>You can track your expenses on a mobile app or document your expenses in a notepad. This can help you identify things you can eliminate to boost your savings.</p>
             <li><b>Tip #2 - Make savings a priority in your budget</b></li>
             <p>It is important to add savings as a part of your monthly budget. It is also crucial to fix a savings rate and stick to it each month, irrespective of expenditure.</p>
             <li><b>Tip #3 - Establish your financial priorities</b></li>
             <p>Instead of mindlessly saving or spending, fix specific short-term, mid-term and long-term financial goals. This can offer you a roadmap and help you achieve your goals in a structured manner.</p>
             <li><b>Tip #4 - Allocate a budget</b></li>
             <p>The most important thing when saving money is to exercise strong will power to not touch the money earmarked for savings. Itâ€™s possible that you may give up your resolve to save and utilise the funds for some unwarranted expenditure. Be wary of this. Stick to the budget and do not exceed it. Instead, make all efforts to try and save even from a tight budget.</p>
              <li><b>Tip #5 - Evaluate your spending habits</b></li>
             <p>Constantly evaluate your shopping and spending habits to take advantage of any extra savings possible. You can consider looking at your bank account statements or credit card history for the last few months to get an idea of what, where and how you spend. Based on your findings you can try to avoid some expenses. </p>
             <li><b>Tip #6 - Involve your family</b></li>
             <p>Another good strategy is to involve your family members in your savings habit. You can also create a competition among your family members to see who would save the most every month.</p>
             <li><b>Tip #7 - Find ways to reduce spending</b></li>
             <p>Try to spot the things you can do to lower your expenses, such as unwanted subscriptions, not tracking your weekly and monthly expenses and more. Being conscious of your spending habits can help you curb the need to spend.</p>
             <p>Setting goals while saving money can help you save in a systematic manner. Goals can be either short-term or long-term:
                Short-term goals are events that you expect to happen in the near future. For example, buying a vehicle or going on a vacation. On the other hand, long-term goals are events that have a longer time horizon. Buying a house or planning for your retirement are usually considered as long-term goals</p>
             <li><b>Tip #8 - Open a savings account</b></li>
             <p>The best way to bring discipline in your savings habit is to open a separate account for your savings, apart from your regular salary or business account. Transfer the amount set aside for savings to this separate account. You can then invest in different savings instruments directly from this account.</p>
